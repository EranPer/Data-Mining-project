# Data Mining project
## Step 1
This python code uses the Coronavirus website https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ to fetch data about the virus. The data is both globally and individually for each country , and its history, of coronavirus cases. The code fetchs the data when running it first, and updates it every x time.

## Process explanation
We used requests, beautifulsoup and lxml platforms for creating functions of data parsing. The data is stored in lists, sets and dictionaries. There is also a function for saving the data on a file. The parsing code runs in a loop that updates the data every x time. The user can change the update times by changing it in the constant list in the beginning of the code.

## Installation
You should install python with basic installations, such as DateTime, and all the prerequisites in the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to use the code
After installation, upload the python file to your favorite Python editor and run the code. Alternatively, run the code from the CLI (i.e. CMD in windows). The program fetches the data at first and update it in any given time.
